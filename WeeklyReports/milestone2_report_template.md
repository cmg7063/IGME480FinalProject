# Milestone 2

Report of progress for Milestone 2

Group F
Date: April 8, 2019
Class: 13.1

## About this Milestone 

At this point, you should have base research done on the technologies to use and have your workflow in place. Your focus this week should be on building and developing your program. Next Monday will be Milestone 3, where you will demonstrate your app to the professor. You will need to describe the parts that members contributed. The app will not have to be fully integrated for Milestone 3, but does need to be a working minimally viable product by Milestone 4 for class play test. 

## Questions to Answer for Milestone 2

### Do you have your technologies/SDKs researched? 

List technologies here as well as anything requires further research:

* Unity: Version 2018.3.7f
* Vuforia
* Hardware: Android

### What is the vision for the application you are committing to for the next milestone?
A campus tour application with a set path leading the user to different buildings. When the user gets close to a building,
information will pop up as a text bubble. The user can then click on the bubble to view more information.

### Do you have a workflow in place? 
Yes, at each milestone we define new tasks for the week to get to the next milestone. These tasks are assigned to people and we 
checkup during the standups to see if anything needs to change.

### Do you have a common project started?
Yes, we have a Unity project shared using GitHub.

### Do you have major blocking issues at this time? 
No.

### How will you be employing sound? 
Sound will be used when the user arrives at a building to signal that there is new information to be read. Sound will also be used to signal
the start and end of the application itself.
