## Who is the target user?
- Tourists or proespective students on on-campus tours  

## Concept of Application
- Scene Design: Match the aesthetic of RIT's design (orange, brown, tigers)
- Interactions: Click on AR objects for more info about location (i.e. websites, videos, etc.)
- Sound/Haptic Feedback: Potential sound effect upon arrival at location (vibrations for deaf or HOH students)

## Initial Research
- Using GPS (Google Maps API, etc.) with ARCore
- Placing AR objects at GPS coordinates
- RIT's tunnel system and campus map
- Text-to-Speech (potential add-on feature)
