RIT AR Tour is a mobile application which guides the user around RIT and displays building information when the user arrives to corresponding buildings. We utilize an AR tiger to guide the user to the next building.

## Tech Stack
- Unity
- Vuforia

The target user would be anyone new to the campus and wants to get a better understanding of its landmarks. This could be either new students or visiting families.

The target hardware is any Android device that is new enough to be supported by Vuforia.

The application starts with a basic menu that allows the user to start the tour, see an about page, see a directory of all the locations, see credits for contributions to the app, or quit the app.

We wanted to keep the information as minimal as possible while still informing the user enough. We also wanted to follow the new design aesthetic of RIT's branding.
