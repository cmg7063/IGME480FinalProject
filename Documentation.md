## Project Design
The RIT AR Campus Tour is a Unity Android application that utilizes the GPS, compass, and Vuforia's augmented reality camera to provide enhanced views and information on the academic, dormitory, and dining services on RIT’s campus. Views of RIT’s campus are enhanced with blurbs of information that a visitor or prospective student on RIT’s campus might want to know. Our AR Campus Tour allows visitors to learn about buildings on RIT's campus easily and on their own, allowing the user to search for and navigate to campus buildings through the interface.

### Target User
The target user for the RIT AR Campus Tour is visitors or prospective students interested in learning more about RIT’s campus locations and landmarks. Furthermore, the application can also be useful to students of all years trying to navigate to different buildings for their classes.

### Hardware Platform
The RIT AR Campus Tour is supported by Android devices with Android version 6 and up.

### Visual and Autditory Scene Design
The design of the application takes inspiration from RIT’s homepage, using the same block quotes, fonts, and colors to mimic the look and feel of RIT’s brand. The minimalistic design and color scheme flow throughout the application in each scene.

The RIT AR Campus Tour starts with a menu screen that allows the user to start the tour, view information about the application, see a directory of all the locations available through the tour, view credits for developer and asset contributions, and quit the application. 

Because this is an RIT AR Campus Tour, we were mindful of the fact that RIT houses one of the largest technical colleges in the world for students who are deaf and hard of hearing and therefore did not want to heavily saturate the application with sound cues or elements that rely on sound.

In addition, because we are using portrait mode, the UI is more minimalistic to avoid clutter while still providing useful information to the user.
