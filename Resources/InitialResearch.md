# Initial Research

This document provides link to resources used in our initial research. The following are topics
which we must gather information on to solidify the validity, practicality, and scope of
our suggested project. 

## Google Maps

There is a maps API to be used with Unity 3D.

A link for a video tutorial on using Maps with Unity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ExhMNLmQtc 

A link for the maps API: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/

We get free credit each month which should allow us to use the API as needed for this project.
Routes, locations, and places are available. Further research must be done to see if it contains
information about RIT buildings.

## ARCore

### Object Placement

If we want the user to be able to do this, here is a sample project documentation for this: https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/tutorials/object-manipulation-sample.

if we want to hard code object placement, we should look first at what google maps API provides us. 

## RIT Map

Tunnels on basic campus map: https://icsmap.weebly.com/blog/rit-tunnels-map


## Text To Speech

Perhaps look into another Google API. 

## Haptics

It is strongly advised not to use haptics in ARCore applications. We will not use this.
