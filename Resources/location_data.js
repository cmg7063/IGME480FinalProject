The Third Floor is a quiet floor where you are allowed some noise; this floor is best for individual study. The Fourth Floor is the smallest floor in the library and is a silent floor, meaning there is no talking allowed, making it a great place to go when you want absolutely no distractions.

For example, you can reserve study rooms throughout the library, sign out a laptop for up to 4 hours, and there are a number of places to print and scan documents in the Wallace Library."
